## Stag Party Exercises

Prerequisite:
- NodeJS of any version
- Lots of alcohol

## Exercise 1

Use the preexisting file `ex1.mjs`.

Write a program in Node.js that takes an integer as input and prints a 
pattern of asterisks on the console. The pattern should be a triangle 
with the base of the triangle being the same length as the integer input.

For example, if the input is 5, the output should be:
```
*
**
***
****
*****

```

## Exercise 2

Use the preexisting file `ex2.mjs`.

Write a program in Node.js that takes an integer as input and 
prints a pine tree-like structure on the console. The structure 
should be made up of asterisks, and the height of the tree 
should be equal to the integer input.

For example, if the input is 5, the output should be:
```
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
    *

```
