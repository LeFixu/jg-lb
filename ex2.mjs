/*
Write a program in Node.js that takes an integer as input and 
prints a pine tree-like structure on the console. The structure 
should be made up of asterisks, and the height of the tree 
should be equal to the integer input.

For example, if the input is 5, the output should be:
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
    *


You can test your method with npm test
